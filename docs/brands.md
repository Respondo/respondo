# Managing brands

When you first sign in, you can click `Authorize Brand` and that will help you
connect your brand Twitter account.

When signed in, you can load new tickets associated with your Brand by pressing
the `Refresh` button.

## Brand accounts

We can automatically integrate your Twitter and Disqus accounts. To do so,
navigate to the `Brand Settings` page and you'll be able to authorize or
deauthorize these accounts.

## Brand members

You can add or remove users from your brand. All associated users will be able
to respond to the related Brand tickets using authorized Brand account on that
social network.

## Brand domain

You can define a brand domain. All users which have an email address with this
domain will automatically be added to the associated brand on registration.
