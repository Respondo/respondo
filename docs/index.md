> Ticketing system for social media posts

## Overview

[Respondo](https://respondohub.com/) uses a ticket approach to social media
(similar to Zendesk). You can filter tickets by status and search them by author
name or content.

## Sign In

Authentication is handled exclusively with OAuth. This allows the users to easily
sign in with just one click using one of their social accounts.

## Basic navigation

While signed out, you can see all
[authenticated brands](https://app.respondohub.com/brands), but can't respond to
any ticket.

When you select one of the authenticated brands, you can choose between
`Open tickets` and `Solved tickets`.

Every time somebody mentions the brand's handle on any social network that is
currently integrated with that brand's Respondo, a new ticket is created under
`Open tickets`.
