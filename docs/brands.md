# Managing brands

When you first sign in, you can click `Authorize Brand` and that will help you connect your brand Twitter account.

When signed in, you can load new tickets associated with your Brand by pressing the `Refresh` button.

Currently, we can automatically integrate your Twitter and Disqus accounts. To do so, navigate to the `Brand Settings` page and you'll be able to authorize or deauthorize these accounts.

You can also add or remove users from your brand. All associated users will be able to respond to the related Brand tickets using authorized Brand account on that social network.
